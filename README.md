# fundamentals-of-bioinformatics

Greetings, I gave this class for several semesters at Georgia State University, and I wanted to memorialize it here, as it was in Spring 2025.

## Course outcomes

Bioinformatics is an intersection between statistics, molecular biology, and computer science. Learning bioinformatics will have different meanings depending on your background. Advancing yourself in all three of these fields will aid in your success. However, many other skills will help you here, and so success can also come in the forms of learning other related skills.

In addition to bioinformatics, this course will also touch on how bioinformatics can aid in the study of infectious diseases. This will help give real life meaning to these academic exercises and will help you get real career skills in bioinformatics.

## Additional resources

* Christensen, [Introduction to Bioinformatics in Microbiology](https://a.co/d/6LzF0Oe), 2023 (second edition)
* Rob Edward’s Computational Genomics Manual 
  * Website <https://linsalrob.github.io/ComputationalGenomicsManual/>
  * Rob Edward’s YouTube playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpPXw4zFa0uLMHwSZ7DMeLGjIUgo1IBbn>
* Many more resources for the curious: <https://github.com/lskatz/awesome-bioinformatics-education>

## Computing environment

**This class requires the Linux command line**.

You will be required to install the Linux command line. There are a few ways you can do this including:

* MacOS already has the command line.
* Ubuntu Linux already has the command line.
* Windows: [WSL2](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-subsystem-for-linux/9P9TQF7MRM4R) from the Microsoft app store.

Additionally, you might find it helpful to install a proper text editor. I recommend that you use the program VSCode.

## Agenda

Suggested readings refer to the Christensen textbook unless otherwise noted.
